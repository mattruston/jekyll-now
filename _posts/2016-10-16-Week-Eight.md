title: "Week Eight: Allocation"
---

### What did I do this past week
This week we began on the Allocation project. Up until this point, everything we have done in code was simply defined on the stack, so everything made was tied to the scope. This project takes a look at how to make your own "heap" so that you can both allocate classes faster, and within memory that wonâ€™t be lost when you exit the scope. So far we have all of the methods required for our allocator class written, and if everything behaves as we imagine, they should work fine. We are currently in the process of writing the unit tests for each method.

Other than talking about the project, in class we looked again at initializing different types of variables, such as arrays, and the costs associated with each one. On Friday we began looking at how to implement the vector class, which was pretty neat to see how it works under the hood.

### What's in my way
I am still finishing up some big assignments for other classes, but those should be done soon. Tomorrow I begin working part time, so from now on I will need to make sure I schedule my time well enough to get everything done.

### What will I do next week
My plan for this week is to finish up writing the unit tests for the allocator project, and double check that everything works as it should. Other than that, it should be a fairly normal week.

### My experience
I have found these past few lectures fairly interesting. We are getting to learn about certain inefficiencies in code that I previously had not even though about. The one thing that I found pretty odd with C++ is that you can't copy arrays with just the "=" operator. I believe the reason to not have it is backwards compatibility with C, but generally it seems fairly strange.

### Tip of the week
Today's tip of the week: Form a routine. For a lot of people it can be difficult to actually work on side projects. However, the hard part is usually starting. If you create a routine where you set aside time everyday to program for at least an hour, or even just follow a rule such as pushing to your code once a day, you will find that it is much easier to work on projects.
