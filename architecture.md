The Seona Reid Building contains many studios and workshops for the students at The Glasgow School of Art. There are also offices, seminar rooms, a lecture theatre, and ample space to showcase projects created by the students. The white walls of the building act as "blank canvases for the work of the students", and the many windows and open space provide for plenty of natural lighting.

### Contrasting Styles

<p>In this image of the building's exterior you can see the contrasting styles of the old stone used in much of the surrounding buildings, against the new smooth surface of the glass panels. The intention of the design was to move the art school into the 21st century, with a modern look of open spaces and lightweight materials. While the glass surfaces that cover the building give it the appearance of a light building, it was actually constructed with concrete as the frame that is behind the panels. The combination of the old style surrounded by the new one helps integrate the building into the surrounding city.</p>

### A Sheer Facade

<p>Here you can see the smooth facade of the building. From this side you can also notice the interesting geometry of the building. While it ultimately fits the city block as a rectangle, the shape within that is more abstract and even flows inside.</p>

<h3> Holl’s ‘homage’ to Mackintosh in Glasgow<br />A building that could be described as symphonic </h3>
This article examines Holl's claims about what he envisioned for the building when it was complete. It starts by discussing the impressions the building gave when it was first being built, and how its appearance was "curiously over-scaled". It continues to talk about Holl's past in architecture and how it relates to the materials used in the construction of the Seona Reid Building. In the end, the article specifically looks at how the building doesn't really fit as a 'homage' to the Mackintosh building, but rather as a "companion", due to its beautiful modern design.

### A Look Inside

<p>This image inside reveals how spacious the building feels, with high ceilings and the different levels being open to one another. Here you can also see one of the open columns that goes all the way to the top of the building, allowing light to come in and keep everything well lit. All of the walls are simply painted white, allowing for students' art to be the main focus when put on display.</p>

<p>The building is located in a city, surrounded by many other buildings. From above the building doesn't really stand out; shaped as a rectangle so that it best fits in with the rest of the city without wasting space.</p>

### My Drawing

![My Drawing](https://github.com/mattruston/mattruston.github.io/blob/master/images/Seona-Reid-Drawing.jpg?raw=true "My Drawing")

<p>In my sketch I tried to capture the contrasting styles of the dark, stone, masonry of the old building it was built over, compared to the slick, gray, modern style. I also tried to show the exact angles and lines the modern style has compared to the more textured and splotchy stone of the surrounding buildings.</p>

### Video Through the Building

Watching this video truly revealed how open the building was, and how every space felt connected. The shots at night showed how the building glows from the lights inside shining through the semiopaque side panels.

### Pertinent Facts About Holl

<http://inhabitat.com/interview-exclusive-7-questions-with-architect-steven-holl/>

- Holl believes that architecture needs to strongly be a part of its environment, but should go deeper than the style of the environment. This fits with the Seona Reid Building, which had a main focus of being a 'homage' to the neighboring building, but has a far different style.
- Holl believes that light is one of "the core aim[s]" of architecture. Because of this he puts great emphasis on the lighting of a building, which is seen in the Seona Reid Building.
  * "Space is oblivion without light"

- Holl believes that the environment created by architecture feels alive and inspires others. This matches with his intentions for the Seona Reid Build to inspire the students working in it.
