### What did I do this past week
This first week of classes was a fairly short one, but already I can tell this will be a great semester. We spent most of the first day going through the typical information about the course and then getting a quick preview of C++ by looking at a simple program that outputs a line of text. The joy of looking at actual code in class again was a wonderful thing. The remainder of the week we got a look into testing code, and the right and wrong ways to use asserts. Overall, his discussion with the class reminded me closely of a discussion I had last semester with my peers about assertions, so it is cool to know that most of what we will be talking about is practical knowledge that will be used in my day to day work.

### What's in my way
Downing showed us many tools that we will use this semester, many that I have used before and some that I have not. I began by trying to use Docker, but after just installing it I wasn't sure how to move forward. Hopefully more instructions will be posted once the first project is available.

### What will I do next week
Next week will be our first full week of classes, so I hope to start getting more in depth into the class material.

### My experience
So far I am super excited for this class. Downing seems to have a very interactive teaching style, constantly asking the students for their input even if it is just "Wouldn't you agree that...". My only concern is he seems to be teaching off the assumption that most students have Java as their strongest language, and is comparing C++ to Java. Having done very little Java in the past two years, I do not fully remember the syntax and so if I have to relate C++ to Java in the future I might have a difficult time. But in the end that is really my only complaint, and it is a fairly small one.

### Tip of the week
Get a head start on as much as possible. As soon as any information about what you will be working on in class is posted, start looking into it. Even if you aren't able to make much progress, just being more familiar with it will make future explanations given about it so much more valuable.
