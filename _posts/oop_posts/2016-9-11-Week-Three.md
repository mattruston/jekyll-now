title: "Week Three: Project One Complete!"
---

### What did I do this past week
This week I worked on and finished Project One! Overall I found the project fun to work on. The problem itself wasn't very difficult, so I was able to play around with the code trying different optimizations. Setting up Travis and writing the tests also didn't take too much time. The difficulty that came in was just trying to make sure everything was absolutely perfect for submission. Since this is the first assignment for the class, I just am not certain how Downing wants the work completed yet. Other than the project, the classes continue to be interesting, although having worked in similar languages, what we are learning doesn't feel entirely new. What I haven't seen before are references, which essentially are just creating a new variable that is the same thing, not a copy or pointer, but the same, as what it is initialized as. The best way that I can think about these variables are as pointers to what they are assigned, that are always automatically dereferenced.  

### What's in my way
Right now I have an open path ahead of me. As always I have readings to do, but other than that there is nothing major. In this time I plan to work on some personal projects and try to stay on top of everything else.

### What will I do next week
Project Two! I am excited to see what we will be doing next, and this next project we get to do in groups. I tend to end up doing a lot of my work close to its deadline, so being in a group forces me to work at a more steady pace. It also tends to be more fun to work on things with friends, so I am excited for this one.
The career fair is next week, so this week I am going to make sure my resume is ready and I will start emailing with some of the companies that are already looking for applicants. I hope that I will get more interviews this year now that I am a junior. I also hope that companies won't only want me for iOS, since that is what most of my experience is in.

### My experience
This class continues to be my most enjoyable one for the semester. My only concern is how difficult grades will be as the class goes on, having heard how others did in past semesters. All I can do for now though is keep doing the readings and paying attention in class.

### Tip of the week
This week's tip is to start talking to companies as soon as you can. Don't wait for the career fair when everyone else is also applying, it will become more difficult for you to stand out. If you begin emailing and talking with companies beforehand, you will be able to build a relationship with them, so even if you don't end up getting a job with them, you will know them and have more connections in the future.
