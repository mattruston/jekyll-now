### What did I do this past week
This past week was just a lot of projects. I spent a lot of time getting everything working for my graphics project the first few days. All of Wednesday and Thursday were then spent working on the SWE project and making sure everything for that was ready. I had very little free time between getting everything finished up, so then Friday and Saturday were spent relaxing.

In class we have been looking at SQL and how to get different types of results by acting on a couple tables.

### What's in my way
Fortunately I do not have too much in my way this week. I do have another graphics project due on Wednesday, but it was a quick extension on the last project. I finished the majority of it today without having to work too long, and the rest should hopefully be quick as well.

### What will I do next week
I need to finish up the projects I have, but my main focus will probably be getting my story for work finished up before next week. Since I have been spending more time focused on my school projects, I haven't been at work as much as I would have liked, and so I am a bit behind where I planned to be. I should be able to catch back up, but that will be my focus for the week.

### My experience
SQL has not been as interesting to look at in class as previous topics. A lot of the examples and ways to solve them seem fairly confusing, and even though we have to try to work out some of them before seeing the answer, I am not sure if what I worked out actually works or not. Since there might be multiple ways to get the desired solution, my answer might also work even though it tends to be fairly different from what Downing has done. I could try building the tables and actually running the queries, but I have been so busy recently I haven't gotten around to it.

### Tip of the week
Write down your ideas. This applies to both coding and other creative things. Once you have everything you were thinking about on paper, it is easier to see where you can improve, or where you might be missing something. If you simply just sit there thinking about it, your train of thought might remove important parts, or make jumps that no longer make sense. It is also hard to come up with and maintain details if the only place you are storing that information is in your head.
