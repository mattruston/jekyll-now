title: "Week Five: A Trip to Mars"
---

### What did I do this past week
This week marked the completion of the Netflix project. Overall the project wasn't that difficult. The hints that Downing gave in class basically led us right to a solution that was fast enough. Also, since he had the students put the caches they were using all in one place, it wasn't hard to see what optimizations other groups were using. In the end, the most difficult thing with this project, similar to the first, was just making sure all the little things were good before submission.
The highlight of the week, however, was not the project, but instead the trip we took to Mars. On Wednesday we had a speaker from JPL come talk to the class, and his work was amazing. He showed us how they use the Microsoft HoloLens to simulate walking around on Mars, using real images to build a 3D environment. The tools available, such as being able to pull up every picture ever taken of any rock, to being able to walk on Mars with coworkers, were absolutely stunning. The talk reminded me of how amazing the applications of technology can be, and reminded me of why I love being in computer science.

### What's in my way
I don't have too much in my way this week. My first test of the semester is on Tuesday, so hopefully that goes well.

### What will I do next week
This coming week has nothing on the calendar so far, so I imagine it will just be a normal week of classes.

### My experience
The career fair also happened this week. I unfortunately did not talk with as many companies as I would have liked, but I feel like the discussions went well with the companies that I did talk to. Generally I am trying to apply to a lot of companies right now, and while it doesn't actually take that much time, it feels like it does.

### Tip of the week
Today's tip of the week: Dress nicely to the career fair, but also comfortably. I made the mistake of wearing dress shoes that really were not meant to be walked in. As a result, I had about five blisters on each foot within the first hour at the career fair. This caused me to be less focused when talking, and forced me to leave earlier than I should have due to pain.
