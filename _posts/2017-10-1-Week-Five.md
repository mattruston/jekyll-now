### What did I do this past week
This week we finished up making the static version of our site, and I have to say it looks pretty good so far. This is mostly thanks to my group members who understand good design and how to use HTML and CSS well. While I looked through the code as it was being made, my responsibilities for this first part of the project were mostly focused on getting the project working with Flask, setting up each of the tools we are using and connecting them with GitHub, and deploying the site on the Google Cloud Platform. As we move into making the site dynamic, I will be helping out with learning React and getting everything switched over to using that instead of all of the site just being statically written. Overall our group worked well together. Each time we met up to work we had almost every member, and were able to use our time productively. We were never rushed to get anything finished, and we are happy with how it turned out.

### What's in my way
This week I have two interviews lined up, one of which is an all day interview tomorrow. On top of that, my next graphics project is due on Wednesday, which I have not been able to work on very much yet. This means I will probably spend a lot of time on Tuesday making sure everything for it is working so that I don't run up against the deadline Wednesday night.

### What will I do next week
This week will just be focused on preparing for interviews and getting my assignments done on time. In general I am not quite as pressed for time this week, so everything should go well.

### My experience
In class we are starting to look at some pretty neat little things about Python. Specifically, we have looked at how quickly different ways of writing a function run, and the interesting behaviors and uses of iterators and iterables. These kinds of things are what I find to be the most enjoyable parts of Downing's classes. If I were to just be programming and picking up the language on my own, it would take me a while to figure out the little ins and outs of the language that are really useful but somewhat obscure.

### Tip of the week
Talk through your problems with someone. Discussing your thought process and even explaining your code can help you figure out what you might be doing wrong. It's even better if they are someone who also programs, since you will feel more obligated to convince them of your reasoning, and they might have some input you never thought of.
