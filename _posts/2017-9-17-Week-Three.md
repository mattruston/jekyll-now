title: "Week Three: Getting busy"
---

### What did I do this past week
This past week things started to ramp up. I finished up the first project for this class, began on the first graphics project, taught the first iOS workshop for the semester, and got ready for and went to the career fair. All in all things have gotten pretty busy. In class we began to go over the content I was looking forward to, which is the basics of python and fundamentally how it works as a language. Getting to understand the ins and outs of the language really helps with understanding the best ways to solve problems with it, and I am glad we are on more interesting topics than the basics we started out on.

### What's in my way
I have quite a bit on my plate this week. Just to start, I will need to be working on my graphics project every day to make sure I am able to get that done on time. I also have two interviews already lined up for this week that I need to be getting ready for. On top of all of that and my other weekly activities, I believe project two for this class will be posted soon, so I will need to start getting that finished.

### What will I do next week
My plan for the week is to just take everything day by day and try not to get too overwhelmed with the things I need to get done. The projects I need to work on are fairly large, but if I just work on them consistently, they will get done. I also hope we get project 2 sooner than later so that I can start meeting with my partners and figure out how we plan on doing the project.

### My experience
Right now everything is pretty good. I am happy with my classes and what we are learning in them. It was just my luck, however, that when I got called on in class, every question I was asked was about Java. I haven't really used Java since high school, and while I could probably get back into it fairly easily, answering questions about it on the spot is not the easiest. A lot of other languages have filled my experience between now and then.

### Tip of the week
Work on coding challenges in your free time. I never really used anything like HackerRank before, but since we used it for the project, I started sitting down and doing some quick problems in my free time. They tend to be easy to get into, and don't require a good idea or much motivation to start on. Just spending 15 minutes between classes working on one instead of sitting around gives you some good experience and really isnâ€™t that tiring. I wish I had been doing them sooner than my senior year.
