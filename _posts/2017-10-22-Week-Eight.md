title: "Week Eight: Scraping"
---

### What did I do this past week
This past week was mostly focused on getting my graphics project done on time. It was a cool project where we used openGL to display the menger sponge fractal. Making the sponge was only a third of the project, the rest was focused on adding camera controls so that you could move the camera around in space, and creating an infinite plane to be the floor below the cube. In the end I was able to finish almost all of it on time. The only thing I couldn't get working was having a checker pattern on the floor and correctly having shadows on the cube. 

In SWE we began looking into SQL by creating relations and their functions in python. So far it has been interesting to look at how each of the functions relate to each other, and how we are able to write them on our own.

### What's in my way
Tomorrow I will fly out all day for an on-site interview, so I won't be at class and probably wont have much time to work on other things. I also have another graphics project I need to start on, as well as more work I need to do for the next part of our SWE project.

### What will I do next week
Tomorrow I will interview, and then Tuesday and Wednesday I will continue working on gathering the data from the different sources to put into our database for our site. After that, I will start working on the next graphics project so that I can hopefully get it done early, since I will need to fly out the following week when it is due for another interview. 

### My experience
These past few days I have been writing code to scrape data from other sources to use with our SWE project. While using one source tends to work pretty well, we have started to run into issues where that one source doesn't have all the information that we need. Now we need to grab that information from another source, and somehow link that data to the data we gathered from the first source. Since the information is coming from two different sources, there is no direct key to link everything, so the challenge is figuring out how to match the data together. Going through manually would obviously work, but doesn't work when we want it to happen to hundreds of different objects. So currently that is the problem I am working on for our project. It is interesting but fairly challenging.

### Tip of the week
Make sure you don't commit sensitive data such as keys to git. Since git tracks the diff history of your project, even if you remove the keys later, they can still be found unless you fix the git history to not have them.
