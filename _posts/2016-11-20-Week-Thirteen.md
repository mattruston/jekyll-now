title: "Week Thirteen: Abstract Classes"
---

### What did I do this past week
This week we continued to look into virtual methods and abstract classes, but this time we made the classes actually abstract. By setting one of the methods in the class "= 0", the class becomes an abstract class. This means that you can no longer create an instance of the class, and that the methods marked with "= 0" are expected to be implemented by subclasses of the abstract class.

On Wednesday we had Spiceworks come and talk to us about what working in the real world is like. They discussed the kind of work they do and ways that we can improve our chances of getting hired.


### What's in my way
For some reason I thought there were far more weeks left in the semester, but this turned out to not be the case. We only have two more weeks of class, and this upcoming one is only two days. I have a couple final assignments to wrap up, and then we will be quickly moving on to winter break!

### What will I do next week
This week I need to turn in another draft for a final essay. Other than that, we only have two days of classes, so not too much. I will be flying home to spend Thanksgiving with my family, which will be nice since I haven't been out of Austin since the Spring.

### My experience
After talking in last week's blog about how much I didn't like having to have a class act as an abstract class without truly being abstract, it was really nice to learn about abstract classes this week. Essentially every issue I pointed out was addressed this week, which definitely made me happy.

### Tip of the week
Today's tip of the week: Always be on time. Being there a couple minutes before hand is even better. I know people working in groups who planned on meeting at certain times, but people wouldn't show up until a while after, if they even showed up at all. This is a waste of time for everyone involved and does not lend itself to productivity.
