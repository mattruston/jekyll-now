### What did I do this past week
This past week wasn't too bad. We had our first test for the class, and it went rather smoothly. Many of the questions on the multiple choice section were questions that were either on previous quizzes, or were very similar to ones that had been on quizzes. There were only a few small things that I was uncertain about, but in the end I did fairly well. It was my first time taking a test where we also had a portion on Hacker Rank, and it was nice to be able to compile code during a test, removing the fear of a small syntax error.

### What's in my way
This week I am back to being busy with projects. Right now, I have a graphics project that needs to be completed by Wednesday. Each part of the project alone doesn't seem too bad, but there are many parts, and a lot of small details that can take a while to understand properly. Once I finish that up I will need to start working on the next section of our website for SWE.

### What will I do next week
This week I will just be working on projects as much as I can in my free time trying to get everything completed on time.

### My experience
Generally I was very pleased with the testing experience. One thing that I think could be improved on for future tests is to break up the test cases into multiple files. This way, instead of having one test case that would either pass everything or fail, we could see how many cases we were passing. Then if anyone is struggling to pass them all, they can at least move towards a solution that passes as much as possible. However, one thing that is good about the one test case that I'm not sure you could do with many is that when it fails it would tell you the assertion that was failing. I'm not sure how this information would be presented if there were multiple test cases, and this knowledge is probably more useful than the number of tests passing. The choice to not show how many tests we are passing might also be intentional, since it is a test after all, in which case it is pretty good how it is.

### Tip of the week
Keep a consistent sleep schedule. While it sometimes is easy to work at odd hours, or all at once, sleeping at consistent times will help you feel less tired during the day, making it easier for you to be productive and get things done.
