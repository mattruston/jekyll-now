### Expectations
I have fairly high hopes for this class. I really enjoyed taking OOP last year, and hope to get a similar in depth look into Python as we did with C++. I have used Python a couple times in classes and on some small personal projects, so I'm hoping to learn all the small details about the language that I don't know during this class. The only thing I am sad about so far is that groups will be random for the project this semester. While I understand it is intended to be more like working in the real world where you don't get to choose your teams, it does mean I won’t get to work on some of the project ideas I had with some friends. I might be able to try to make one of these ideas with my random group, but I don't know how invested the other members will be, and generally am doubtful that it will turn out as well as I would like. These ideas are also ones that I didn't come up with alone, and so I would rather just work on them with the people who helped with the ideas. I can always try to work on them outside of class, but having a project that you want to work on also be for a class typically gives it priority and helps get it done. We will just have to see who I get grouped with, but in the end I'm sure it will be fine.

### What did I do this past week
We did not do too much this first week. We mostly just talked about what we would be covering in each of my classes. In an attempt to stay somewhat ahead, I began setting up the first project for my graphics class since I have heard it can be time consuming.

### What's in my way
Right now I don't have anything blocking me. I am excited for assignments to start being posted so that I can start getting a head start.

### What will I do next week
I believe our first project will be posted this week, so I plan on getting everything for that finished pretty early on. I am also excited for my graphics class, so I will be refreshing myself on linear algebra and hopefully begin moving into some of that material.

### My experience
Overall, I still really enjoy Downing's classes. I like the way he teaches and I am excited for us to start getting into some material that I haven’t seen before. Obviously this first week covered some of the more basic material, but I'm sure I will start to learn some new things soon.

### Pick of the week

While this is mostly specific to Objective-C, I still think this is an interesting concept. Thinking about how your tools work and understanding what you can do with them is an important thing to consider when you are programming.
