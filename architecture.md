The Seona Reid Building contains many studios and workshops for the students at The Glasgow School of Art. There are also offices, seminar rooms, a lecture theatre, and ample space to showcase projects created by the students. The white walls of the building act as "blank canvases for the work of the students", and the many windows and open space provide for plenty of natural lighting.

<h3> Holl’s ‘homage’ to Mackintosh in Glasgow<br />A building that could be described as symphonic </h3>
This article examines Holl's claims about what he envisioned for the building when it was complete. It starts by discussing the impressions the building gave when it was first being built, and how its appearance was "curiously over-scaled". It continues to talk about Holl's past in architecture and how it relates to the materials used in the construction of the Seona Reid Building. In the end, the article specifically looks at how the building doesn't really fit as a 'homage' to the Mackintosh building, but rather as a "companion", due to its beautiful modern design.
