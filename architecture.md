The Seona Reid Building contains many studios and workshops for the students at The Glasgow School of Art. There are also offices, seminar rooms, a lecture theatre, and ample space to showcase projects created by the students. The white walls of the building act as "blank canvases for the work of the students", and the many windows and open space provide for plenty of natural lighting.

<p>In this image of the building's exterior you can see the contrasting styles of the old stone used in much of the surrounding buildings, against the new smooth surface of the glass panels. The intention of the design was to move the art school into the 21st century, with a modern look of open spaces and lightweight materials. While the glass surfaces that cover the building give it the appearance of a light building, it was actually constructed with concrete as the frame that is behind the panels. The combination of the old style surrounded by the new one helps integrate the building into the surrounding city.</p>

<h3> Holl’s ‘homage’ to Mackintosh in Glasgow<br />A building that could be described as symphonic </h3>
This article examines Holl's claims about what he envisioned for the building when it was complete. It starts by discussing the impressions the building gave when it was first being built, and how its appearance was "curiously over-scaled". It continues to talk about Holl's past in architecture and how it relates to the materials used in the construction of the Seona Reid Building. In the end, the article specifically looks at how the building doesn't really fit as a 'homage' to the Mackintosh building, but rather as a "companion", due to its beautiful modern design.

### A Look Inside

<p>This image inside reveals how spacious the building feels, with high ceilings and the different levels being open to one another. Here you can also see one of the open columns that goes all the way to the top of the building, allowing light to come in and keep everything well lit. All of the walls are simply painted white, allowing for students' art to be the main focus when put on display.</p>

<p>The building is located in a city, surrounded by many other buildings. From above the building doesn't really stand out; shaped as a rectangle so that it best fits in with the rest of the city without wasting space.</p>
