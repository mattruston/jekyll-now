title: "Week Four: Netflix"
---

### What did I do this past week
This week the second project was released. The project is called Netflix, and the assignment is to write a program to solve the Netflix challenge. This challenge was presented a couple of years ago by Netflix, and the goal was to write a program that could guess the rating a user would give a movie with as close of a star rating as possible. We are given access to a database of user ratings and movies, and from that we need to predict how those users would rate other movies. It is a very interesting project because we get to work with large amounts of data, and the problem itself is one that occurred in the real world. Other than that, the week felt fairly short for OOP. The first day was just talking about the project, the second day we had a guest speaker from Bloomberg talk, and the last day we just talked some more about c++.

### What's in my way
I have a couple writing assignments for other classes that are coming up, as well as my first tests. Other than that just preparing for the career fair and making sure everything is done on time.

### What will I do next week
This week I will be working to finish up the Netflix project (it feels like we had very little time for this project), going to the career fair, and starting to study for my upcoming tests.

### My experience
This week went by fairly quickly, so I am just trying to make sure I am on top of everything that needs to be done, and I don't feel like I have too much to talk about right now.

### Tip of the week
Today's tip of the week: There is a UTCS app on the app store. It includes everything from upcoming events to news articles, and can also show you which computers are currently being used in the labs. In addition, you can also check your available disk space on the CS computers, and look through a directory of the professors. Overall it has some helpful bits of information.
