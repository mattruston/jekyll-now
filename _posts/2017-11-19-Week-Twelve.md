### What did I do this past week
Compared to the rest of the semester, this past week was fairly relaxing. I only had one project due, and I had it pretty much finished up before the week even started. Other than that, I had to finish up some units for my LEB course, and then finished up my tasks at work. The unfortunate turn of events is that I now have a cold. Even though I got to relax and rest a bit, I am now sick and tired as a result.

In class we had guest speakers come in on Wednesday to talk about ethics and different ways of evaluating which decisions to make. It was enjoyable to listen to, but I have already covered everything they talked about in a couple of other classes.

### What's in my way
I don't really have anything in my way right now. I am quickly approaching deadlines for full time offers, so I will need to decide on that, but in terms of work I don't have too much to do.

### What will I do next week
This week I will be flying home to Chapel Hill, NC, to visit with family for Thanksgiving. It should be a relaxing week for the most part, but I will still bring my laptops with me so that I can get some work done.

### My experience
I don't think this week presented much new. My main focus before our test will be making sure I understand all the SQL commands. The refactoring that we have been looking at tends to make sense and follows good design, although using strings of class names in order to create instances seems super unsafe, and is not something I would ever use just to remove a switch statement. Having identifiers and selectors as strings has been something I have seen frequently in iOS development, and all practices have been shifted towards moving away from that so that you do get compile time errors instead of runtime errors.

### Tip of the week
Work on projects with others. When you work with others you get to see and learn different design patterns and code styles that you might not be used to yourself.
