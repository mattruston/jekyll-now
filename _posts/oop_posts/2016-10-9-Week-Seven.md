title: "Week Seven: The Test"

### What did I do this past week
This week we had our first test. Overall I don't think it was too bad, however I did spend a lot of time studying prior to taking it. Since I wasn't really sure what to expect on the test, I spent a lot of time trying to make sure I was knowledgable about almost everything said in class. In the end, I actually think the test didn't cover too much that was taught in class, but what it did cover was definitely the more important material. It focused more on just seeing if we were able to write code using what we learned, and wasn't just multiple choice questions meant to see if you caught every detail of an unrealistic program. Now that I know what to expect, I think the next test will go even better.

### What's in my way
This week I have a lot of writing assignments due for other classes. This generally means I will have less free time. I am also starting my part time internship next Monday, so I am trying to be on top of everything so that I have ample time to get work done.

### What will I do next week
This week we are beginning on our next project, Allocator. The project page itself doesn't have too much description, but it looks like we are going to either write a class or a couple methods that will create our own heap and let us allocate space for variables and objects in it. Overall it sounds pretty neat and I look forward to his explanation tomorrow in class.

### My experience
Like I said above the test wasn't too bad. The only thing I really feel like I missed was trying to template a class with a specific type. On one of the questions we had to create a class that used an int. Normally I wouldn't even have template above the class, but in his implementation example the class was shown as "Digits\<int\>". From what I know the "\<int\>" is shown when the class is templated and in this case it is using an int. However, since the class always uses ints, I wasn't sure how to have the "\<int\>". In the end I guessed having "template \<int\>" above the class which I know is wrong. Other than that, the only things I feel like I could have lost points on were just not having the most optimized code, for example not having const on all the methods that should have it. We will hopefully see how we did soon.

### Tip of the week
Today's tip of the week: Study in groups. Even if you feel like you understand all the content that will be on the test, talking with others will help reenforce what you know by teaching it, and maybe even show you something that you hadn't thought about yourself. Gaining the insight that other minds have is always useful.
