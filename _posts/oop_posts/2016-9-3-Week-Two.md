title: "Week Two: The First of the Projects"
---

### What did I do this past week
Project one was posted, and I have to say I really like the way Downing is structuring the class. The first project is a fairly simple one, just writing a program to solve the 3n + 1 problem, but with a couple optimizations. Initially looking at the project page I wasn't entirely sure exactly what was expected of us, but by the end of the week nearly everything was cleared up. Downing used the project as a base for the lectures, informing us better how to move forward with the project while teaching us key concepts about C++ and how programs should be properly built and tested. Even the questions on the quizzes were related to optimizing our programs, giving us tips on ways to make our code better. We finished up the week looking at functions that throw in order to have better error handling for an executing program.

### What's in my way
I would say that limited time is my largest blocker right now. This past week was fairly busy with a lot of clubs starting up and other classes giving out projects as well. While I am doing my best to manage all of these things, I always feel like there is one more thing that needs to be done.

### What will I do next week
As of now I have only been working on project one locally. In the next couple days I plan to actually push my code up to a repo, set up my tests, create issues, and finally work on the optimizations for the program. I have many other readings and assignments for other classes that I need to stay on top of as well, so prioritizing assignments will be difficult. On top of all of this, I will be helping teach the first iOS workshop for MAD on Thursday, which happens to run right up until project one is due, so I just need to have the project in before then.

### My experience
The workload for this class feels just right, and the assignments are interesting to work on, however I feel like my other classes are pulling me away from that. While we have talked about how it is important to take other classes that require writing, I feel that I may have taken too many. Most of my time outside of extracurriculars has been spent trying to stay on top of my readings and assignments for my other classes, leaving me with less time to play around with my 3n + 1 program. I hope that after this coming week, and more time spent on project one, I will have some better insight about this class as a whole.

### Tip of the week
My tip for this week is that you don't need an idea to get involved in a programming project. Many other computer science students that I have talked to have not worked on projects outside of classwork because they simply don't know what to make. However, being in the community at UT provides many opportunities to get involved in projects. There are numerous organizations that one can join that have projects they need help on, as well as just other students who would love to get together and work. I encourage everyone to get involved and there will always be something to do.
