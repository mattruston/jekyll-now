### What did I do this past week
This week started out on the good news that we get to pick our group for the website! Most of the week then focused on talking about the project. On Monday we had a guy from Google come in to talk to us about the Google Cloud Platform that we will be using to host our website. We then spent Wednesday going over what is expect of our website for the first part of the project. The idea that our group decided to go with for the project is a website that shows information about video games. This will show information such as images and clips from the games, what platforms they can be played on, and much more. Generally our designs and progress so far are looking pretty good, even though we have run into some issues with GCP.

### What's in my way
Generally I am still fairly busy. My graphics project is due tomorrow by midnight, and I have been doing interviews and applying to more companies all week. For the most part I think my graphics project is done, but there are a couple little things that look off, and I'm not sure if they are actually issues or not. Once that is turned in, I will have a bit less to worry about for a few days.

### What will I do next week
This week's plan is to get graphics finished, work on the website, and finish up my other homework assignments day by day. I still have a lot to do, but as long as I keep working each day, nothing should pile up too much.

### My experience
The website is pretty cool so far. Google Cloud Platform seems like a powerful resource, although compared to Heroku which I have used in the past, it seems more complicated. Being complex can be good when you are trying to do a lot with it, but for doing something simple like hosting a site that has a database, some of the complication just makes things needlessly difficult. Once we get over the learning curve, it should all work well. Some of the small details about the project have also been a bit unclear. The general idea of what is wanted out of the project seems to make sense, but the specifics about which ways we should do things have been confusing. For example, many groups I talked with were not sure about if we needed to have React in this first part.

### Tip of the week
Work frequently, but also take frequent breaks. If you get into the habit of relaxing for a while, and then doing all your work at once, you will probably start to feel overwhelmed. If you instead do bits of work with breaks in-between, you will digest the material better, and feel less stressed about getting everything done on time.
